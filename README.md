# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In an effort to develop a successful crowdfunding campaign for the production of a play called "Fever", crowdfunding data from around the world for various types of events or projects were obtained and analyzed. The playwriter has estimated a budget of approximately $10,000 to fund the play. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to review, analyze, and identify possible factors that may contribute to the success or failure of a crowdfunding campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
